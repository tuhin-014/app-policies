    <h1>MoodBit — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>MoodBit ("the App") is developed by VertexLab Solutions. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> MoodBit stores all information locally on your device. No data is transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mood entries (score, tags, notes, timestamps)</li>
        <li>Habit definitions and daily completion logs</li>
        <li>Correlation calculations</li>
        <li>App preferences (dark mode, reminder settings)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export or share it.</p>

    <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
    <p>MoodBit does not use any analytics services, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools. We do not track your usage, behavior, or any other activity.</p>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>MoodBit does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal information to use the App.</p>

    <h2>Data Export</h2>
    <p>You may export your data as a CSV file using the built-in export feature. This file is generated locally and shared via your device's share sheet. We do not have access to exported files.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your data at any time using the "Clear All Data" option in Settings. Uninstalling the App also removes all stored data.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>MoodBit may send local notifications for mood and habit reminders if you enable them. These notifications are scheduled locally on your device and do not involve any server communication.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MoodBit does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The App does not collect any data from any user.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
