<h1>ClearBill — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 21, 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>ClearBill ("the App") is designed with your privacy as a top priority. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal or medical billing information.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p><strong>We collect no data.</strong> All information you enter into ClearBill — including medical bills, insurance details, personal information for dispute letters, and savings records — is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's on-device database technology (SwiftData).</p>

<h2>No Network Access</h2>
<p>ClearBill does not connect to the internet. The app requests no network permissions and makes no API calls, analytics requests, or telemetry transmissions of any kind.</p>

<h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>ClearBill contains no third-party SDKs, analytics tools, advertising frameworks, or tracking technologies.</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>ClearBill may request permission to send local notifications for bill payment reminders and dispute follow-ups. These notifications are scheduled entirely on your device and do not involve any server communication.</p>

<h2>Data Storage & Deletion</h2>
<p>All data is stored locally on your device. You can delete all data at any time through the app's Settings screen. Uninstalling the app removes all associated data permanently.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>ClearBill is not directed at children under 13. The app does not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
