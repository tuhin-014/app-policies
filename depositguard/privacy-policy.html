    <h1>DepositGuard - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>DepositGuard ("we", "our", or "the app") is a rental deposit protection app published by VertexLab Solutions. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> DepositGuard is designed to be completely private:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data (property information, photos, documents, maintenance records) is stored exclusively on your device.</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted to our servers or any third party.</li>
        <li>No account or registration is required to use the app.</li>
        <li>No analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs are included.</li>
        <li>No cookies or similar technologies are used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>DepositGuard may request the following device permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To take photos of your rental property for documentation purposes. Photos are stored only on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To access existing photos for property documentation. Photos remain on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> To optionally tag photos with GPS coordinates for evidence purposes. Location data is stored only on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send optional reminders about lease dates and maintenance tasks. All notification data stays on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device using the device's built-in database and file storage. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Property information and lease details</li>
        <li>Photos and documentation</li>
        <li>Maintenance records</li>
        <li>Dispute letter drafts</li>
        <li>App settings and preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you delete the app, all data will be permanently removed from your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share any data with third parties because we do not have access to your data. When you use the app's sharing features (e.g., exporting a PDF report or sharing milestone cards), you control what is shared and with whom.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>DepositGuard is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
